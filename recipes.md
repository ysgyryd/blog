# Recieps that I have tried:
## Savoury
 - [Red lentil and chickpea soup](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/recipes/red-lentil-chickpea-chilli-soup)
   - Makes easily 4 good portions. Used more lentils instead of the extra chickpeas and added some spinach after to wilt.
 - [Chicken and Sweet Potato Curry](https://www.bbc.co.uk/food/recipes/healthy_chicken_and_46387)
 - [Adam Ragusea: Broccoli in garlic sauce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xt5zzI_3-VA)
 - [Adam Ragusea: Raviloli](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=scwtoKAikck)
## Sweet
 - [Simple Chocolate Chip Cookies](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/user/784559/recipe/easy-chocolate-chip-cookies)
   - I unfortunately baked them too hot or for too long - but they still tasted good. 
   - I would probably use less chocolate chips next time and press them down further so that they would spread out more.  
   - It would be good to try another recipe to see how the quantities affect how the dough spreads out when baking.
